# Co-existence-Problem-Solver-Python-
A Python project that solves the "co-existence problem" by mapping words to the lines where they appear. Users can query words, and the program returns lines containing all of them. It features text preprocessing, efficient lookups with dictionaries and sets, and interactive user input. Optimized for large text files like War and Peace.
